ng-wheel is an open-source Angular library which creates a dynamic prize-winning wheel. It is used to display predetermined winnings while appearing to be random to the user. This can be used to allow a server to determine the prize before the wheel spins, then the wheel would spin and land on the prize that the server selected.

  [items]='items'
  [innerRadius]='50'
  [spinAmount]='10'
  pointerStrokeColor='red'
  pointerFillColor='purple'
  [idToLandOn]='idToLandOn'
  (onSpinStart)='before()'
  (onSpinComplete)='after()'
