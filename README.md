ng-wheel is an open-source angular (2+) library which creates a dynamic prize-winning wheel. It is used to display predetermined winnings while appearing to be random to the user. This can be used to allow a server to determine the prize before the wheel spins, then the wheel would spin and land on the prize that the server selected.

```

Once your library is imported, you can use its main component, ngx-wheel in your Angular application:

```xml
<ngx-wheel
  width='400'
  height='400'
  spinDuration='8'
  [items]='items'
  [idToLandOn]='idToLandOn'
  (onSpinStart)='before()'
  (onSpinComplete)='after()'
>
</ngx-wheel>
```
